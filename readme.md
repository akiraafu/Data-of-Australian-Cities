# Data of Australian Cities - Assessment 2: Apply web technology trend

This is a simple filterable data list of Australian cities. The original data is from [simplemaps.com](https://simplemaps.com/data/au-cities). The data is in JSON format and is stored in a file called `au.json`. The data is loaded into the page using JavaScript.

## Features

Type a name of city in the search box to filter the list of cities. The results will be shown in the list below the search box. The list will be updated as you type.

## built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Github Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/)

## How did I use Github Copilot?

I used Github Copilot to write the JavaScript code for the filterable data list. I also used it to write the HTML and CSS code.

When I write code with Github Copilot, I write comments to describe the purpose of the code. Then GitHub Copilot can analyse the comments to write the code.

The code that Github Copilot writes is not perfect, I need to modify the code to make it work. For example, it didn't create constants for the input elements in JavaScript code, but it creat an event listener for the input element, that caused an error. I had to add the constants myself to make the event listener work. But it is a good start.

Even when I am writing this readme file, Github Copilot is writing the readme file for me.

## What did I learn?

I learned how to use Github Copilot to build a project.

I also learned how to use Github Copilot to write a readme file.
